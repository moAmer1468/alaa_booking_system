# How To Log On Via Postman

This guide explains how to use Postman to log in to your Doctor Appointment Booking System (Spring Boot + JWT) and how to use the JWT token to access secured endpoints.

---

## 1. Log In and Get JWT Token

1. **Open Postman**.
2. **Create a new POST request** to:

   `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login`

3. **Set the request body** to `raw` and `JSON` format. Example:
   ```json
   {
     "username": "yourUsername",
     "password": "yourPassword"
   }
   ```

4. **Send the request**.
5. If credentials are correct, you will receive a response like:
   ```json
   {
     "token": "<your_jwt_token_here>"
   }
   ```

## 2. Use JWT Token for Secured Requests

1. **Copy the token** from the login response (without quotes).
2. For any secured API request (e.g., creating a patient, booking an appointment):
   - Go to the request in Postman.
   - Click the `Authorization` tab.
   - Set `Type` to `Bearer Token`.
   - Paste your token in the `Token` field.

   **OR**
   - Add a header:
     - Key: `Authorization`
     - Value: `Bearer <your_jwt_token_here>`

3. **Send your request**. If the token is valid, you will be authorized.

## 3. Example: Create a Patient

- **Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:8080/api/patients`
- **Headers:**
  - `Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token_here>`
- **Body (JSON):**
  ```json
  {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
    "gender": "Male",
    "contactNumber": "1234567890",
    "address": "123 Main St"
  }
  ```

---

## 4. Common Issues

- **401 Unauthorized:**
  - Make sure you include the `Authorization` header with a valid JWT token.
  - Ensure your token is not expired.
  - Double-check your login credentials.

- **Registering Users:**
  - If registration is open, use `POST /api/users` to create a new user (check your API for required fields).

---

## 5. Summary

- Always log in first to get a JWT token.
- Use the token in the `Authorization` header for all secured endpoints.
- If you get 401 errors, check your token and credentials.
